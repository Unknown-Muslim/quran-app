  This file can be used for any custom CSS that is not handled by Tailwind CSS
  utility classes or directly in your components.

  For most React + Tailwind projects, this file might remain largely empty
  or contain only a few global styles specific to your application's layout
  or custom animations.

/* Example: If you had a specific animation or custom class not covered by Tailwind */
/*
.fade-in-up {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.5s ease-out forwards;
}

@keyframes fadeInUp {
  from {
    opacity: 0;

  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;

/* Add any specific styles for your application here if needed */
